# AutomodScripts
Scripts for use in managing Subreddits, and hopefully good practice examples.

This file is intended to help setup Automod for new moderators of a sub. This is based on my experience modding a NSFW sub. Use at your own peril. T
hese rules have been tested, and work, but may not be suitable for your needs. 

Copy and paste this directly into your Automod wiki, found under Mod tools/Wiki Pages. Save and you are ready to go.
