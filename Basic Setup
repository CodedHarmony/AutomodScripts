#1 Always lock comments in all posts, if you don't want comments

type: submission
set_locked: true

#2 Rule to validate format of the tile

# Valid formats contain
# Age (optional)
# Gender tags in the format word4word (without enclosing, or between square brackets or parentheses)
# A title (currently only validates at least a word and anything else thereafter)
type: submission
set_locked: true
~title (regex): '^(\d{2}\w*)? ?(\[[\w\/]+4[\w\/|]+\]|\([\w\/]+4[\w\/|]+\)|[\w\/]+4[\w\/]+)\.*'
action: remove
action_reason: "Malformed title"
moderators_exempt: false

    Your title doesn't have a proper format.    
    Please be sure to include at least gender tags at the start of your title and a short description of your prompt.   
    Only your age can be included before the gender tags.  
    Gender tags can have any word if you want to be more specific, but they're not officially supported and would be harder to use with the search function.  
     
    Examples:    
    * [M4F] Let's Play a Game  
    * 24 [F4F] lookin for a bestie  
    * (M4TF/F/Femboy) Let's have some fun  
    * 32M4F Looking for a girl to keep me distracted while I'm at work 
    * Make sure there are no white spaces in your brackets, otherwise it will not validate.

url+body (regex): ['https?://(?!\S*(imgur\.io|imgur\.com|redgifs\.com|i\.redd\.it|reddit\.com))[\w\.\-]+'] #add links in to sites that are allowed here

# The "(?!...)" syntax is called Negative Lookahead, meaning- "only match if what's before the parenthesis isn't directly followed by what's inside the parenthesis (after the ?!)"
# The "\S*" means any amount of non-space characters (meaning it's all part of the http url)
# The "[\w\.\-]+" is to match the actual domain for the {{match}} below

  Your {{kind}} submission has been removed as it contains a link to a website that is not allowed in this subreddit. Only links to imgur, redgifs, and Reddit are allowed.
